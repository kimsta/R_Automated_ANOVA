# R-Automated-ANOVA

This repository contains a single R Markdown file that demonstrates a robust function for automating a simple one-way ANOVA.

## Purpose

This project is a public, simplified demonstration of the core logic from a more complex, confidential statistical pipeline I developed.

The goal is to showcase a function that not only performs the analysis correctly but also includes built-in data validation and graceful error handling. The output is formatted into a clean, tidy table using the `broom` package.

## How to Run

1.  Download the `.Rmd` file.
2.  Open it in RStudio.
3.  Click the **`Knit`** button at the top of the script to generate the complete HTML report.
